# canny_dlib_semantic_maps

Use canny_dlib_semantic.ipynb to extract the semantic outputs of face images. Each persons images should be in a separate 
folder datasets/face/train_img. Semantic outputs include face dlib based segments and overlapped with canny edge detectors for 
hairs and background.

Keep the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1poyi9RmH3LWb7sEDJ3Wip5GsI4MY8ZxE/view and 
put in datasets/face
